# ultralight-quick-start

__Clone this repo to try a simple Ultralight app!__

This is a minimal Ultralight app you can use with the [Writing Your First App](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/writing-your-first-app) article in the Ultralight documentation.

## 1. Install the Prerequisites

Before you build and run, you'll need to [install the prerequisites](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/installing-prerequisites) for your platform.

## 2. Clone and build the app

To clone the repo and build, run the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ultralight-ux/ultralight-quick-start
cd ultralight-quick-start
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

> **Note**: _If you run the command cmake .. without any generators on Windows, it will usually select the default 32-bit Visual Studio version you have installed. To force CMake to generate 64-bit projects on Windows, use `cmake .. -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64` instead of `cmake ..`_

> **Note**: _If you run the command cmake .. without any generators on Windows, it may select the 32-bit MSVC toolchain (Ultralight needs the 64-bit MSVC toolchain instead).

To force CMake to generate 64-bit projects instead, use
cmake .. -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 instead of cmake .._

## 3. Run the app

### On macOS and Linux

Navigate to `ultralight-quick-start/build` and run `MyApp` to launch the program.

### On Windows

Navigate to `ultralight-quick-start/build/Release` and run `MyApp` to launch the program.

Using the C++ API
SUGGEST EDITS
ðŸ“˜
Need C API Instead?

We also offer an alternative C API for use within C and other languages!

See Using the C API

Set Up Include Directories
To use Ultralight in your C++ code, simply add the following directory to your project's include directories (replace <SDK_ROOT> with the actual path you've placed the SDK):

<SDK_ROOT>/include/
Include Headers In Your Code
Simply include <Ultralight/Ultralight.h> at the top of your code to import the API.

#include <Ultralight/Ultralight.h>
If you want to use the optional AppCore API (cross-platform windowing/drawing layer), you should also include <AppCore/AppCore.h> at the top of your code.

#include <AppCore/AppCore.h>
Ultralight also exposes the full JavaScriptCore API so that users can make native calls to/from the JavaScript VM. To include these headers simply add:

#include <JavaScriptCore/JavaScript.h>

Linking to the Library
SUGGEST EDITS
ðŸš§
64-bit Only

We currently only offer 64-bit bins (x86_64 / amd64) at this time (upstream JavaScriptCore has dropped 32-bit support).

We will soon be offering arm64 support as well.

Linking on Windows / MSVC
In Visual Studio, go to Linker â†’ General â†’ Additional Library Directories in your project's properties and set one of the following:

 $(ULTRALIGHT_SDK_ROOT)/lib/win/x64/
Then, go to Linker â†’ Input â†’ Additional Dependencies and add the following:

Ultralight.lib
UltralightCore.lib
WebCore.lib
AppCore.lib
Note: AppCore.lib is optional, only link if you use the AppCore API headers..

Linking on Linux
First, copy the shared libraries in $(ULTRALIGHT_SDK_ROOT)/bin/linux to your OS's standard library directory.

Then, add the following to your Makefile's LDFLAGS:

-lUltralight -lUltralightCore -lWebCore -lAppCore
Note: -lAppCore is optional, only link if you use the AppCore API headers..

Linking on macOS
Within XCode, select your target and go to General â†’ Linked Frameworks and Libraries and add the following:

libUltralightCore.dylib
libUltralight.dylib
libWebCore.dylib
libAppCore.dylib
Or alternatively, if you are building with a Makefile, add the following to your LDFLAGS:

-lUltralight -lUltralightCore -lWebCore -lAppCore
Note: AppCore is optional, only link if you use the AppCore API headers..
